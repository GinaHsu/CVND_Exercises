Projects

From top to bottom, representations of: 1. Facial Keypoint Detection, 2. Automatic Image Captioning, and 3. Localization and Mapping

You’ll learn computer vision and deep learning techniques by getting to apply your skills to a variety of projects. The three project in this program are as follows:

Facial Keypoint Detection
Automatic Image Captioning
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
You'll use a combination of computer vision and deep learning techniques to complete these projects; submitting each for review. By the end of the course, you'll have an impressive portfolio of applications.

Elective/Extracurricular Sections
At the bottom of the classroom navigation bar, you can see an Elective section with various lessons. These lessons are meant to be review or supplement your learning in the classroom, but the skills covered in this section will not be required for you to complete the projects in this course. For example, we might put content from Udacity's deep learning program in here as a way to review deep learning concepts. So, it is up to you to decide whether to watch this material or not.

As you go through this course, you will be prompted in text to look at specific elective sections. For example, as you start the "CNN and Feature Visualization" lesson, you will be prompted to consider watching the elective section "Review: Training a Neural Network."

Expertise
Throughout this course, you’ll be learning from academic and industry experts. We've partnered with companies like Affectiva and NVIDIA to bring you information about the latest techniques and advances in data collection, computer vision, and deep learning architectures.
